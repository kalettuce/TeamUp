# Team Report (Status Update)
## Project meeting agenda
* Formalize flow of data between database and front end as well as between components
* Begin writing functions for reading/writing to the database(?) That way we can have the front end components start interacting with those
* Start with user authentication (pick an encryption algorithm, learn about tokens)

## Goals from last week
Execution of the plans; starting to implement some of the designs and working on individual contributions as listed below in the individual team membersâ€™ goals from last week.

## Progress and issues
We now have a web page and a backend that exist, but with no functionality. 

## Plans for next week
Continue adding components and implement at least one basic function for the site, such as displaying user profile pages.

# Team Member Contributions
## Goals from last week
* Chandra: Basic skeleton of the UI with Keith, focusing on the minimum features such as project creation and posting, creating account and login screens.
* Keith: Rough implementation of at least one component on the app.
* Brian: ER diagram for data, learn how to use firebase.
* Brandon: Learn how to use firebase, implementation of one component in the app

## Progress and issues
* Chandra: Aimed to create a UI skeleton last week, but that turned out to be a bit too ambitious; mainly spent the week instead trying to understand how to use the Firebase API in the React app and getting the JavaScript files, React router, and workspace prepared. We got it figured out after our team meeting.
* Keith: Partially set up one table in the database which is expected to complete before the end of this week. Completed the structural setup for the server to house a multi-page application.
* Brian: Created ER diagram and database schema and learned how to view and edit the database on Firebase. Made a script to deploy in one step.
* Brandon: Created the landing page for the website. Learned the basics of firebase when it comes to deploying

## Plans for next week
* Chandra: Basic skeleton of the UI with Keith, focusing on project creation and posting
* Keith: Complete the dummy entries in the database, complete the user profile page, and get started with the user authentication.
* Brian: Add mock data so front end can start making components that read and write data. Tweak the database schema if problems come up.
* Brandon: Finish another website page/component. Figure out how the components will talk to each other. Create basic functions for database interaction and tests for them.
