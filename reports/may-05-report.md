# Team Report (Status Update)
## Project meeting agenda
* Formalize the basic functionality we want to complete before the beta release

## Goals from last week
Continue adding components and implement at least one basic function for the site, such as displaying user profile pages.

## Progress and issues
Completed the projects lists page. However, it currently only uses dummy data. 

## Plans for next week
Finalize and one single functionality in preparation for the beta release.

# Team Member Contributions
## Goals from last week
* Chandra: Basic skeleton of the UI with Keith, focusing on project creation and posting
* Keith: Complete the dummy entries in the database, complete the user profile page, and get started with the user authentication.
* Brian: Add mock data so front end can start making components that read and write data. Tweak the database schema if problems come up.
* Brandon: Finish another website page/component. Figure out how the components will talk to each other. Create basic functions for database interaction and tests for them. 

## Progress and issues
* Chandra: Created the projects list page with pagination functionality and added dynamic URL.
* Keith: Added dummy data for testing purposes. 
* Brian: Edited the database schema to be more redundant but able to more efficiently find the information we need, and added some mock data for testing purposes.
* Brandon: Created a navigation bar for the frontend. 

## Plans for next week
* Chandra: Add individual project pages
* Keith: Add functionality for adding/retrieving real data
* Brian: Research what needs to be stored for authentication and how to store it securely.
* Brandon: Finish the login/signup popups and create login functionality
