# Team Report (Status Update)
## Project meeting agenda
* Come up with a new distribution of workload (page component, authentication, UI design, database design, etc.)
* Talk about how to incorporate Firebase into a React project and look into documentation

## Goals from last week
We will prepare our individual contributions and spend this week gaining familiarity with the tools we plan to use. We will communicate our readiness in next week’s meeting to begin implementation.

## Progress and issues
We set up the Github repository with some starter code and filled out the README. Project can now be deployed with a short series of commands.

## Plans for next week
Execution of the plans; starting to implement some of the designs and working on individual contributions as listed below.
