# Team Report (Status Update)
## Project meeting agenda
* Confirm role assignments.
* Review the project description with TA to check if the features we have proposed are within reasonable scope for this project.

## Goals from last week
None

## Progress and issues
We wrote the Project Requirements document and came up with a plan for how to develop the project. Every team member has been assigned a role, we have agreed upon the technologies we plan to use, and we have a GitHub repository, Slack channel, and Zoom meeting room set up for collaboration. There have been no issues so far.

## Plans for next week
We will prepare our individual contributions detailed below and spend this week gaining familiarity with the tools we plan to use. We will communicate our readiness in next weekâ€™s meeting to begin implementation.

# Team Member Contributions
## Goals from last week
None.

## Progress and issues
Much of the work we have done this week is with pre-planning in terms of work distribution and other team organizing efforts. We have not yet begun implementing the technical details of the product. There have been no issues so far.

## Plans for next week
* Chandra: Have a basic sketch of the UI design and layout of the website for initial feedback from team members.
* Keith: By the beginning of next week, create a list of necessary items of information to be stored in the DB in order to provide service.
* Brian: Create a Heroku account and get familiar with how it works.
* Brandon: Work alongside frontend developers to create and design plan for endpoints required by the frontend.
