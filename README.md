# Team-Up (CSE403 Project)
## About the Project

It is challenging for small teams to recruit new members for projects; many must resort to generic social platforms like Facebook or Instagram to raise exposure, but their posting is often drowned out by other posts and unable to be found by those who would be interested. **Team-Up** aims to address this problem: it is a community-based web platform that is specifically designed to help connect people to projects. Team-Up allows people to post projects that they're working on, a description of their project, and the roles of team members that they're looking for. It also enables people to join projects that interest them, and project creators can invite others to join their project. Team-Up is unique because our hope is that the type of projects it helps to centralize are small, student-led, or non-profit projects that are looking for contributors. Our project differs from other platforms because it places strict emphasis on team-building for a diverse range of small-scale projects rather than job-hunting, networking, or larger, corporate recruitment. Whether someone is starting a student organization or seeking collaborators to create a new app, Team-Up is there to help bring exposure to their project and build a strong and passionate team.
